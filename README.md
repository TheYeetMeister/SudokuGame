## My Sudoku Game, made using C++

Hello! This is my Sudoku Game I've built using mainly C++ to run the logic. If you've never played Sudoku, here's a list of the rules that you follow:


## Sudoku Rules
### Sudoku Rule № 1: Use Numbers 1-9
Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated? As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game – the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.

### Sudoku Rule № 2: Don’t Repeat Any Numbers
Sudoku is played in such a way that in a given coordinate, there should not be a repeat number in either the column, row, or general larger grid.

Here's an example:
